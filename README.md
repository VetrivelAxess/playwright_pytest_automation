## What is Playwright?

Playwright is a fairly new test automation framework from Microsoft.
It is open source, and it has bindings in TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, .NET, and Java.
Some of the nice features Playwright offers include:

* concise, readable calls
* easy out-of-the-box setup
* very fast execution times (compared to other browser automation tools)
* cross-browser and mobile emulation support
* automatic waiting
* screenshots and video capture
* built-in API calls

Microsoft is actively developing Playwright,
so new features are coming all the ti       |
